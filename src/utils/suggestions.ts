 * three words typed as one buffer. Suggestions only make sense per-word:
 * comparing "did you mean" alternatives across a word boundary would be
 * meaningless. So this splits on "_" first and evaluates each segment on
 * its own — the UI renders one section per segment, and a fresh "_"
 * naturally starts a new section as soon as the user types it.
 *
 * Within a segment, this tokenizes it (the same tokenizer the real engine
 * uses, so multi-character keys like "th" are treated as one unit), finds
 * every token that belongs to a confusable family (data/confusables.ts),
 * and for that position lists every distinct-output spelling in the
 * family — the one the user actually typed included, so the UI can show
 * "here's what you have, and here's what else you could have meant" as
 * one comparable list of full words (e.g. "fwr → फोर", "fOr → फ्व्र",
 * "for → फर"), not just the single swapped letter.
